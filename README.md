# Recipe Box App
 
 **WiP**
 
A Free Code Camp project built with React

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/xVXWag)

**User Stories:**

* I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
* I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
* I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
* I can edit these recipes.
* I can delete these recipes.
* All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

**Personal objectives:**

* Mobile First
* Styled Components
* Client-side validation
